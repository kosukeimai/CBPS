version date      description
0.1     07/19/12  The first version on CRAN
0.2     09/27/12  The second version.  Fixed a bug in the ATE CBPS.
0.3  	01/18/13  The third version.  Updated the ATE variance estimate.
0.4     03/30/13  Adds function for fitting marginal structural model.  Fixed standard error in cross-sectional case.
0.5 	05/07/13  Adds function that handles three- and four-valued treatments.
0.6 	06/05/13  Adds multiple binary treatment case, as well as extending plot and summary capabilities.
0.7     07/24/13  MAJOR BUG FIX.  In versions 5 and 6, CBPS for the cross-sectional case interprets 1 as untreated and 0 as treated.  This has been fixed.
0.9	08/07/14  Adds CBPSContinuous.  Major changes to interface for and backend of CBMSM.
0.10	09/07/15  Adds nonparametric estimation.  Simplifies CBPS output.  Numeric treatments now interpreted as continuous, and factors are interpreted as multi-valued.  Improves interface for ATT.
0.11	04/29/16  Adds Improved CBPS from Han et al through the baseline and diff arguments.
0.12	11/01/16  Fixes bug that affected the weight for the first observation in the continuous case.  Fixed bug that caused npCBPS to ignore choice of corprior.  Added SVD to CBPS Optimal.
0.13 	12/27/16  Fixes bug for CBPSOptimal, changes balance conditions for CBPS Continuous, and fixes issues with covariance matrix of coefficients.
0.14	10/01/17  Added hdCBPS and analytic covariance for versions.  Changed behavior for over-identified continuous CBPS when weighting matrix is singular.
0.15	11/16/17  Added access to linear predictor.  Fixed bug with CBPSBinary caused by the introduction of sampling weights in 0.14.  Switched to using Roxygen.
0.16	12/19/17  Fixed bug for binary CBPS when standardize is set to FALSE.  Fixed test tolerance for Solaris.
0.17	01/29/18  Reuploaded to CRAN.
0.18	03/09/18  Improved numerical precision and improved compatibility with systems that where long data types are disabled.  
0.19	06/14/18  Updated CBMSM so it has three start options: CBPS, glm, and optimal, the default.  Optimal tries CBPS and glm and implements the one with the smallest criterion value.  If criterion is smaller at standard stabilized weights, those are returned.
0.20    03/21/19  Major update on hdCBPS
0.21	08/10/19  Documentation update.
