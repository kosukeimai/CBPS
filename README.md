# CBPS: Covariate Balancing Propensity Score [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kosukeimai/CBPS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kosukeimai/CBPS) [![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/CBPS)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CBPS)


Implements the covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) proposed by
[Imai and Ratkovic (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12027). The 
propensity score is estimated such that it maximizes the resulting covariate
balance as well as the prediction of treatment assignment. The method,
therefore, avoids an iteration between model fitting and balance
checking.  The package also implements several extensions of the CBPS
beyond the cross-sectional, binary treatment setting.  The current
version implements the CBPS for longitudinal settings so that it can
be used in conjunction with marginal structural models from [Imai and
Ratkovic (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2014.956872), treatments 
with three- and four-valued treatment variables, continuous-valued
treatments from [Fong, Hazlett, and Imai (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1214/17-AOAS1101), 
and the situation with multiple distinct binary treatments administered 
simultaneously. In the future it will be extended to other settings including 
the generalization of experimental and instrumental variable estimates. Recently 
add the optimal CBPS which chooses the optimal balancing function and results 
in doubly robust and efficient estimator for the treatment effect.
