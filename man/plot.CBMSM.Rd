\usage{
\method{plot}{CBMSM}(x, covars = NULL, silent = TRUE, boxplot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \dQuote{CBMSM}.}

\item{covars}{Indices of the covariates to be plotted (excluding the
intercept).  For example, if only the first two covariates from
\code{balance} are desired, set \code{covars} to 1:2.  The default is
\code{NULL}, which plots all covariates.}

\item{silent}{If set to \code{FALSE}, returns the absolute imbalance for
each treatment history pair before and after weighting.  This helps the user
to create his or her own customized plot. Default is \code{TRUE}, which
returns nothing.}

\item{boxplot}{If set to \code{TRUE}, returns a boxplot summarizing the
imbalance on the covariates instead of a point for each covariate.  Useful
if there are many covariates.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to plot.}
}
\value{
The x-axis gives the imbalance for each covariate-treatment history
pair without any weighting, and the y-axis gives the imbalance for each
covariate-treatment history pair after CBMSM weighting.  Imbalance is
measured as the absolute difference in standardized means for the two
treatment histories.  Means are standardized by the standard deviation of
the covariate in the full sample.
}
\description{
Plots the absolute difference in standardized means before and after
weighting.
}
\details{
Covariate balance is improved if the plot's points are below the plotted
line of y=x.
