\usage{
CBMSM(formula, id, time, data, type = "MSM", twostep = TRUE,
  msm.variance = "approx", time.vary = FALSE, init = "opt", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula of the form treat ~ X.  The same covariates are used
in each time period.  At default values, a single set of coefficients is estimated
across all time periods.  To allow a different set of coefficients for each 
time period, set \code{time.vary = TRUE}.}

\item{id}{A vector which identifies the unit associated with each row of
treat and X.}

\item{time}{A vector which identifies the time period associated with each
row of treat and X.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible
by as.data.frame to a data frame) containing the variables in the model. If
not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)},
typically the environment from which \code{CBMSM} is called.}

\item{type}{"MSM" for a marginal structural model, with multiple time
periods or "MultiBin" for multiple binary treatments at the same time
period.}

\item{twostep}{Set to \code{TRUE} to use a two-step estimator, which will
run substantially faster than continuous-updating.  Default is \code{FALSE},
which uses the continuous-updating estimator described by Imai and Ratkovic
(2014).}

\item{msm.variance}{Default is \code{FALSE}, which uses the low-rank
approximation of the variance described in Imai and Ratkovic (2014).  Set to
\code{TRUE} to use the full variance matrix.}

\item{time.vary}{Default is \code{FALSE}, which uses the same coefficients
across time period.  Set to \code{TRUE} to fit one set per time period.}

\item{init}{Default is \code{"opt"}, which uses CBPS and logistic regression
starting values, and chooses the one that achieves the best balance.  Other options 
are "glm" and "CBPS"}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed through to \code{optim()}}
}
\value{
\item{weights}{The optimal weights.} \item{fitted.values}{The fitted
propensity score for each observation.} \item{y}{The treatment vector used.}
\item{x}{The covariate matrix.} \item{id}{The vector id used in CBMSM.fit.}
\item{time}{The vector time used in CBMSM.fit.} \item{model}{The model
frame.} \item{call}{The matched call.} \item{formula}{The formula supplied.}
\item{data}{The data argument.} \item{treat.hist}{A matrix of the treatment
history, with each observation in rows and time in columns.}
\item{treat.cum}{A vector of the cumulative treatment history, by
individual.}
}
\description{
\code{CBMSM} estimates propensity scores such that both covariate balance
and prediction of treatment assignment are maximized.  With longitudinal
data, the method returns marginal structural model weights that can be
entered directly into a linear model.  The method also handles multiple
binary treatments administered concurrently.

##Load Blackwell data

data(Blackwell)

## Quickly fit a short model to test
form0 <- "d.gone.neg ~ d.gone.neg.l1 + camp.length"

			data=Blackwell, type="MSM",  iterations = NULL, twostep = TRUE, 
			msm.variance = "approx", time.vary = FALSE)

##Fitting the models in Imai and Ratkovic  (2014)		
##Warning: may take a few mintues; setting time.vary to FALSE
##Results in a quicker fit but with poorer balance
##Usually, it is best to use time.vary TRUE
form1<-"d.gone.neg ~ d.gone.neg.l1 + d.gone.neg.l2 + d.neg.frac.l3 + 
		camp.length + camp.length + deminc + base.poll + year.2002 + 
		year.2004 + year.2006 + base.und + office"

##Note that 	init="glm" gives the published results but the default is now init="opt"

is based on the code for version 2.15.0 of the glm function implemented in

likewise modeled on the documentation for glm and borrows its language where
